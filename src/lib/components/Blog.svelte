			I first encountered mystical women who practice alternative healing in 2005. I was six years
			old. As a child, I was prone to coughs that lasted for weeks. Store-bought medicines couldn’t
			help me, so my mother took me to a traditional healer, an old woman, who gave me a
			fuchsia-colored tonic to drink for a couple of days. It was made from a certain bark of a tree
			that she grew in her yard. Whatever her story was or whether she was a mystic healer or not,
			my coughs suddenly stopped because of that tonic she gave me and I was able to live a simple
			childhood. I never saw her again, but the curiosity I have for those types of people remained
			with me. It was not until my father started coughing blood in 2012 that my family decided to
			reach out to another healer in Lower Jagobiao, Mandaue City in Sitio Lourdes. The healer is
			recognized as Inday Fe or ‘Day Fe.

				‘Day Fe’s method
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				Based on my observations back then, ‘Day Fe’s practices were different from the methods of
				other traditional healers. The local healers that I know of relied on their ancestors,
				elves, and “dili-ingon nato” (in Cebuano dialect) or supernatural nature beings for their
				ability to heal (as what they claim). But ‘Day Fe depends on the Virgin Mary and the Holy
				Trinity for what she does. Aside from healing, ‘Day Fe is also a clairvoyant (which means
				she can look into a person and instantly know who the person is, what they’re feeling, what
				they desire, and what their possible future looks like).

				<br />
				<br />

				This is how ‘Day Fe’s method of healing goes: First, she will ask the individual to confess
				their sins. Second, she will say a prayer and begin the procedure by putting her hand on the
				specific area of the body where the discomfort is felt or where the source of the illness is
				located. The amount of time of the healing would depend on how severe the pain is. When the
				session is over, ‘Day Fe recommends ways to help the person heal faster such as using her
				blessed water, avoiding certain types of food, avoiding unpleasant emotions (like anger and
				worry), wearing a scapular or other religious paraphernalia, regular prayers, and following
				her suggested number of days of healing.

				How my research started
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				While visiting a friend in Leyte last February 2023, we happened to pass by a tranquil place
				of prayer called the church of Our Lady of Marangog. The building, high and tall, almost
				blends with the sky because of its bright blue color.

					</div>
				</div>

				Here’s the thing: I was stuck with finding a research topic for a subject called “Research
				in Oral Literary Traditions.” But upon entering the church, I saw a life-sized statue of the
				Virgin Mary similar to the one in ‘Day Fe’s yard. I immediately remembered her and realized
				that not a lot of people know about what she does or who she is, so I decided to tell her
				story as well as find out the significant events in her life that led her to become a
				clairvoyant healer. On March 8, 2023, I visited her again. Before I could say anything or
				tell her about my plans, she sat down on one of the porch chairs and told me:

				Even though I already knew she would know, you can still imagine how surprised I was. By the
				end of April 2023, I have accomplished the interviews and transcriptions for my research.
				The following discourse is the product of the first two phases. Read my whole research and
				the life story of ‘Day Fe<br />

				The Story of ‘Day Fe
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				‘Day Fe’s healing and clairvoyant skills began after Pope John Paul II and the Virgin Mary’s
				appearance on the dawn of November 4, 2004. These are the exact words that Pope John Paul II
				uttered in her dream/vision:

				<div class="flex flex-row border border-black/10 shadow-md rounded-md my-8 space-x-8 p-6">
					<img src="quote.png" alt="one" width="150" height="200" />

					<div class="text-2xl italic font-georgia font-medium">
						“Wake up. Wake up, my daughter. You are chosen by God. Say to the whole world that God
						is existing and loves all the people.”
					</div>
				</div>

				<br />

				The newfound abilities scared her at first, but she put all her faith in the Virgin Mary and
				decided to let go of any fear. She said that she could now tell what people were feeling
				emotionally and physically just by looking at their faces or knowing their names. ‘Day Fe
				was now able to discover a person’s desires and secrets. She laughed when she told me this.
				According to her, this gift was from the Virgin Mary herself and the blessing was from the
				Holy Trinity. The number of people who visit ‘Day Fe’s home also keeps growing as months and
				years pass by. ‘Day Fe’s time and energy kept declining as well because of the hours she
				spent healing and attending to dozens and dozens of people from her town and other
				barangays. She prayed to the Virgin Mary for days to request guidance and assistance.

						The statue of the Virgin Mary in `Day Fe’s yard
					</div>
				</div>

				<br />
				One morning, she was asked by the Blessed Mother to gather bottles and gallons of clean water
				in the yard, hold out her hand, and say a blessing. The Virgin Mary taught her how to bless the
				clean waters for the people to drink and use for their healing at home. When asked during the
				interview about the significance of using water as a medium for healing, ‘Day Fe said that the
				statue of the Holy Mother responded to her mentally with these exact words:

				<div class="flex flex-row border border-black/10 shadow-md rounded-md my-8 space-x-8 p-6">
					<img src="quote.png" alt="one" width="150" height="200" />

						“Because water is essential to the body Water cleanses the heart and soul Water is

					</div>
				</div>

				Many ill individuals come to her home. People who have lost their faith, who are emotionally
				disturbed, who have unexplainable diseases, and who have become hopeless cases in the
				hospitals have thrived in her care through her healing touch and the use of the blessed
				water, the Virgin Mary’s gift to the people according to the clairvoyant healer.

				A Diagnosis of Stage 4 Breast Cancer and OI
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				A 46-year old female was diagnosed last September 2022 with stage 4 breast cancer and
				brittle bone disease or Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a disease in which bones fracture or
				break easily often with no injury or cause (National Institutes of Health). She and her
				sister went to the University of Cebu’s Medical Center (UCMed) for treatment but the doctors
				said that she was already in critical condition and would require immediate laser treatment
				for her bones and chemotherapy for her cancer. If not, the doctors said she can only live
				for at least 3-4 months after the diagnosis. According to her, the treatments cost 50,000
				pesos per session. Because they could not afford it, one of her elder sisters suggested the
				faith healer, ‘Day Fe from Jagobiao. Before she went to ‘Day Fe for healing, she could not
				stand up or walk on her own and she was bedridden most of the time. ‘Day Fe observed and
				healed her for 115 days. By April 2023, she could now stand up and walk on her own, the cyst
				on her breast had become smaller as months passed by, and she is now in lesser pain compared
				to her condition 7 months ago.

				A Life Saved
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				Two young women visited ‘Day Fe in 2016. Upon healing the first young woman, ‘Day Fe sensed
				a strange energy from the second one. Apparently, this young woman was planning to end her
				life that day. When ‘Day Fe told them this, the second young woman cried. How could ‘Day Fe
				knew about it when she never told anyone? In ‘Day Fe’s vision, she saw this young woman
				floating dead in the waters after jumping from the Marcelo Fernan bridge. She told the young
				woman to give up the thought of suicide and instead go to Ayala Center Cebu’s Bo’s Coffee
				with the first young woman. ‘Day Fe said that they will meet their future husbands there.
				The second young woman didn’t believe this at first but she eventually followed what ‘Day Fe
				told them. While sipping their coffees in the coffee shop the next day, two foreigners
				approached the young women. Today, they are both married. ‘Day Fe and her husband were
				invited to the wedding but unfortunately, they weren’t able to attend because of ‘Day Fe’s
				hectic schedule that day.

				Nosebleeds and a Fever
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				In Barangay Camputhaw, a 51-year-old female said she knew about ‘Day Fe from her stay-out
				house maid and neighbor. During that time, she had a high fever that included frequent nose
				bleeding. Her two daughters kept getting nose bleeds too even at school. This had gone for
				weeks. The doctors could not provide any explanation for this and only provide them with
				medications that were only effective for a little while. Luckily, ‘Day Fe was in Camputhaw
				in 2010 to heal people and bless some water. Because of this, she took herself and her
				daughters to ‘Day Fe. At first, it was difficult for her to believe in ‘Day Fe’s practice.
				It was when their fever and nose bleeding stopped a few days after they used ‘Day Fe’s
				blessed water without taking any medications. Every 8th of September, she and her daughters
				always visit ‘Day Fe’s house to celebrate the day of the Virgin Mary.

				A Mother and Son Healed
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				Last 2007, a young man who had a cyst on his left neck caused him severe pain. He and his
				mother had a consultation with his company doctor at work where he was provided with
				antibiotics. Unfortunately, after a month, the cyst still remained on his left neck. They
				went to Vicente Sotto Medical Center (VSMC) in Cebu City and were also advised for biopsy.
				The mother did not let her son push through the surgery because of financial reasons and due
				to the fact that the procedure might worsen the condition of her son. She remembered ‘Day
				Fe, whose children were her students in high school. She decided to let ‘Day Fe heal her son
				using the healing touch and the blessed water. After a month, the cyst on her son’s left
				neck completely disappeared. The same thing happened to the mother way back in 2014. Only
				this time, she had swollen lymph nodes. She was also advised by doctors for immediate
				expensive operation. Instead of going through surgery, she went to ‘Day Fe again and relied
				on faith, ‘Day Fe’s touch, and the Virgin Mary’s blessed water. Her swollen lymph nodes went
				back to normal in 2015. Until now, she and her family always visit ‘Day Fe as much as they
				can.

				Ovarian Cyst
			</div>
			<div class="pt-8 font-georgia text-left text-md text-black leading-10">
				In 2015, a 46-year-old woman found out that she had a 7-cm ovarian cyst that was active and
				growing. Her husband told her to undergo an operation but she wouldn’t. Instead of paying a
				huge amount of money for surgery, the woman went to ‘Day Fe for healing. After one month,
				she went back to the hospital for a check-up and was happy to find out that her cyst had
				become smaller and inactive. She is 54 years old today and healthy. She said that she never
				took any medicine for maintenance and only relied on prayers, ‘Day Fe’s healing, and some
				blessed water.

				Dozens of people have been healed by ‘Day Fe but I couldn’t reach out to all of them. I

				impossible to deny the reality of sickness, despair, tragedy, and our mortality on earth –
				but choosing to believe there is a ray of light in the midst of hovering dark clouds will
				make these things bearable and possible to overcome. Don’t you think?
